## Condition based Token

**Condition based token is a wrapper that locks the underlying token under user defined condition contract.**

Project consists of:

-   **1**: You can send tokens to another contract with predifined condition written in condition contract.
-   **2**: In this project I had created a condition where the user can transfer the underlying token to another address whose credit score is above certain threshold which is verififed by Ethereum Attestation Service attestation.
